This bottle-sqlalchemy plugin integrates SQLAlchemy with your Bottle application. It connects to a database at the beginning of a request, passes the database handle to the route callback and closes the session afterwards. SQLAlchemy manage sessions and connections to optimize anything it want.

The plugin inject an argument to all route callbacks that require a `db` keyword.


Bottle SQLAlchemy plugin is a work in progress and API changes can happen until I decide the best way to do it.

You are welcome to help with ideas, use cases, questions, issues, etc.

Use Bottle SQLAlchemy as you want.
